# Blackjack
Blackjack is a program to demonstrate Stacks and Queues. This allows us to deal, shuffle, count, and get a value for each card in the customary fashion of blackjack.

This program uses 3 classes:

BlackjackGame: This is where the game operations are performed including the dealing, hitting/standing, and winning/losing.
Card: This creates a string with the values of rank and suit to identify cards and use them within the program.

Deck: This is where the cards are stored and shuffled, and this is also where the cards are created by pulling from the top of the deck using a stack (LIFO).

Player: This is where hands are stored and where the value of your hand is calculated, we add cards to the hand using a queue (FIFO) to make sure we only pull the amount of cards desired.

Using these classes and stacks/queues we are able to create a fully functioning game where the cards are pulled from the deck and put into your hand, and the dealers hand, in a Blackjack fashion.
